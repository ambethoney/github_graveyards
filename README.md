# github_graveyards
a selection of sleepers

<h2>It all started two weeks ago,</h2><p> when I was having coffee with a developer friend. I asked her how she stays inspired, what she's working on outside of the office, if there are any new libraries or frameworks or ideas she's interested in. After a shrug, she said how her "Github is a graveyard, a collection of unfinished, uninspired projects".</p>

<p>You need inspiration, and some repos need some love. Click the randomize button and be presented with a repo that hasn't been touched in at least three months. Maybe it gives you a new idea. Or maybe you stumble upon the next Twitter (or AirBNB or Instagram or...) that's half finished that you'd like to commit to. Either way, this little app was built on react & sass, and gave me something to work on for the afternoon. &#9829;</p>
